# HouseCostPredictorRFR

In this problem, i have tried to predict the house price on the basis of some features like latitude, longitude, number of rooms, population of a district and median income of people
To solve this problem i have used RandomForestRegressor and also many sklearn modules like pipeline, SimpleImputer and many more.
